# Dress To Express

## Problem Statement
I've been thinking about how what we wear can affect our lives. How the garments look affects our personal identification, our relationship to the nature. Nowadays, people spend too much time indoors, and may becme oblivious, or insensitive to things happening in the real world.

## Project Description
 Dress to Express is an experimental project that use garments to visualize APIs, and connect users to what's happening in the outside world, in nature. For this prototype, I designed a dress with three neopixel strips that can visualize a forcecast from a weather API. It will show different colored patterns when the weather changes, and users can change which city's weather displayed on the phone through Bluetooth low energy. It can also connect to the Foursquare API, and when the user come near the ice-cream shop (random idea from a friend haha), the dress will change color to a specific color. It can be connected to New York Times API, and when there's a new article about feminism posted, the dress change color into pink.


The end goal is to make the app customizable so that the wearer can connect to any API of their choice to reflect their own personal interests. The goal is for the wearer to immerse themselves into the outside world, while looking fashionable!
